	<h3>This game allows the user to move a pumpkin from left to right with arrow keys to catch the falling candy. Using turtle's painter and onkeypress methods, we were able to create a Halloween themed background and implement arrow key features for a more interactive game with the user. Additionally, we took what we learned from 1.1.8 and programmed the candy to fall from the sky, using lists and conditional statements. </h3>
