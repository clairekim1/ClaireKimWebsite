	<h1>1.1.9 Falling Candy Game</h1>
	<img src="images/Screen Shot 2022-09-29 at 8.07.09 PM.png" height="300">
	<br>
	<h2>This game allows the user to move a pumpkin from left to right with arrow keys to catch the falling candy. Using turtle's painter and onkeypress methods, we were able to create a Halloween themed background and implement arrow key features for a more interactive game with the user. Additionally, we took what we learned from 1.1.8 and programmed the candy to fall from the sky, using lists and conditional statements. </h2>

	<h2>Using our knowledge from past lessons of lists, abstractions, and variables, we created an interactive game of Air Hockey where users can play by using arrow keys to control their pads and play against an opponent. A scoreboard is displayed at the top to keep track of each player's points.</h2>

	<h1>1.3.1 Santa's Cookies ECard</h1>
	<img src="images/spongebob.PNG" height="300">
	<h2>We created an ECard for a Children's Hospital and implemented user input features, lists, iteration, conditionals, and functions, to allow for a kid-friendly and fun experience for the children viewing our card. There are many colors and silly gifs, as well as music.</h2>

	<h1>Scratch Project: Wedding Dress Up</h1>
	<img src="images/website.PNG" height="300">
	<h2>To create this project, we used several events and procedures to allow users to click through different hairstyles, dresses, etc. to dress up a character for her wedding. We added many costumes and changed the code to incorpoate the new elements.</h2>

	<h2>The above graph represents the inland forests. We believe the blue line represents the occasional thunderstorms and varying howls of wind, and that the green line represents the light. Additionally, the red line may represent the smooth constant temperatures that vary while the yellow line represents the little to no wind. In this project, our models could be used as a comparison to the data that this lesson provided, allowing us to determine which were the most similar by temperature, noise, light intensity, and wind, and ultimately the location of the rover.</h2>
